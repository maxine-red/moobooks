# How to contribute

Thank you for thinking about contributing. You are awesome!

Contributing is quite easy though.

If you want to see a feature, there are two ways to add it:
- add an issue and let people be assigned to it
- fork, create your feature ands start a pull request

This project uses RuboCop for style guidiance and tries to be conservative with
gems included.

Thanks again for considering to contribute!
